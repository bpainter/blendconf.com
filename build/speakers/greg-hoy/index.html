          A little more about Greg
        </h2>
        As CEO, Greg Hoy brings 20 years of interactive design and management experience to Happy Cog. Greg began his career in sales and marketing in 1992, before turning his focus to interactive design in 1994. He worked as a web designer for 10 years, and has managed teams since 1997. His career spans the publishing, media, insurance, and tech consulting industries. An entrepreneur at his core, he has launched several successful companies. Greg and industry pioneer Jeffrey Zeldman partnered in 2006 to expand Happy Cog's footprint to Philadelphia, and later further expanded the company's reach and capabilities by merging with boutique design studio Airbag Industries in 2009. Greg received his BA in Management from Gettysburg College, where he now is an active alumni and serves on the college's Marketing and Communications committee.

          <p>"No one looks back on their lives and remembers the nights they had plenty of sleep" — J. Cornelius</p> <p>Your personal success isn't just delivered to you on a silver platter. You have to hustle and make things happen yourself. Getting ahead means working hard, smart, and building trust along the way.</p> <p>If getting ahead in your line of work means getting promoted and/or making more money, Greg is here to assist you. Bosses promote hard, smart workers. And you don't have to pull 60-80 hour work weeks to do it. You just have to know what they are looking for.</p> <p>Greg has been managing teams for two decades. Through the course of his experience, he's learned that the people who are most likely to advance in their careers are those who embody specific characteristics — characteristics he will share with you that you can put into action immediately. When it comes to review time, you manager will be looking for them. If you follow them, you'll have a significant advantage.</p>
