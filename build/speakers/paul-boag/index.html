          Digital Adaptation – Time to Untie your Hands
        </h3>
        <p>
          <p>Do you feel like you are doing your job with one hand tied behind your back? Are you frustrated by company practices that are horribly antiquated and inappropriate for the digital world. Does your boss or client fail to understand the unique characteristics of the web?</p> <p>If so you are not alone. The majority of traditional businesses are struggling to adapt to the digital economy and need your help even if they don’t realise it. In his talk Paul explains why this is, and what we (as the web community) can do about it. He highlights that to build a great website we have to be the catalyst for organisational change and recommends ways to start that happening.</p> <p>Things you will learn include:</p> <ul> <li>Why so many organisations are failing to adapt.</li> <li>Why it falls to you to instigate the change in company culture.</li> <li>Practical ways of instigating change.</li> <li>Why your primary job isn’t to build websites, despite what your boss or client might think.</li> </ul>
