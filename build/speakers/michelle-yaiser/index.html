          Michelle's Presentation
        </h2>
        <h3>
          Hands-on with Polymer
        </h3>
        <p>
          <p>Web Components allow for the viewing of web applications as a set of encapsulated, maintainable and reusable components. This half-day session will teach participants to work with the Polymer libraries to begin creating web components today, while learning about concepts such as the Shadow DOM, HTML Imports and Custom elements. This is a bleeding edge session, based on pre-alpha software, but it’s also insanely cool and undeniably useful. Michelle Yaiser and Michael Labriola invite you to come learn how to integrate these pieces into your process today in order to bring sanity and reuse to your world.</p>
