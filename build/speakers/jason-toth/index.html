        <h3>
          More Than UI: How the Brand Plays a Role in the User Experience
        </h3>
        <p>
          <p>For years, branding and user experience design seem to be a discipline mixture more reminiscent of oil and water than peanut butter and jelly. However, the need for companies to communicate their values, messages, personality and products in a multi-channel yet consistent experience makes the line between branding and experience design razor thin. Touching on the intersection of marketing, service design, product design, technology, and customer/user experience, this talk will consider what the UX designer’s role could be within this landscape and whether or not we are (or should be) considering the brand experience in user experience design.</p>
