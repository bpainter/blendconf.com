          Getting Your First Design Job in Tech
        </h3>
        <p>
          When you have no work experience under your belt, how do you show employers you’d still be a great design hire? I’ll discuss my experience hiring and getting hired at tech startups like Dropbox, Codecademy, and Treehouse. I’ll also identify the characteristics that signal to employers you have an explosive trajectory—and make it easy for them to say, “Yes!”
