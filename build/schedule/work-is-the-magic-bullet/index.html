  <title>Work is the Magic Bullet with Greg Hoy | Blend Conference: Sept 11-13 in Charlotte, NC</title>
  <meta content=""No one looks back on their lives and remembers the nights they had plenty of sleep" — J. Cornelius Your personal success isn't just delivered to you on a silver platter. You have to hustle and make things happen yourself. Getting ahead means working hard, smart, and building trust along the way. If getting ahead in your line of work means getting promoted and/or making more money, Greg is here to assist you. Bosses promote hard, smart workers. And you don't have to pull 60-80 hour work weeks to do it. You just have to know what they are looking for. Greg has been managing teams for two decades. Through the course of his experience, he's learned that the people who are most likely to advance in their careers are those who embody specific characteristics — characteristics he will share with you that you can put into action immediately. When it comes to review time, you manager will be looking for them. If you follow them, you'll have a significant advantage." name="description" />
