      <h2>
        Growing the <strong>Charlotte tech community</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Charlotte tech community has experienced a substantial amount of growth over the past few years. With the rise of community tools like <a href="http://www.meetup.com/find/?keywords=web&radius=25&userFreeform=Charlotte%2C+NC%2C+USA&sort=member_count&eventFilter=mysugg">Meetup.com</a>, long standing local events like <a href="http://barcampcharlotte.org/">BarCamp Charlotte</a> and <a href="http://www.ignitecharlotte.org/">Ignite Charlotte</a>, and supportive companies like <a href="http://skookum.com/">Skookum</a> and <a href="http://packardplace.us/">Packard Place</a> pushing the local city government to recognize our potential, things continue to grow at an accelerated pace.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea of hosting a national web conference in Charlotte was originally conceived by a group of local community organizers who recognized the need to provide our community with a little something extra. To test and see if the community would support a paid web conference, Packard Place along with local organizers and the kind folks at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/atlantawebdesign/">AWDG</a> hosted the area's first successful web conference called <a href="http://webafternoon.com/">Web Afternoon</a> in the fall of 2012.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Taking a <strong>different approach</strong> to web conference
      </h2>
      <p>
        The past 4-5 years of work prepared the way for Charlotte to be able to host a large scale, national, web conference. We decided to take a very generalist and diverse approach to create a conference that focused on human beings, their connections face-to-face, and helping them work together.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          We are bringing together <strong>60+ speakers</strong> around the country that are some of top practitioners in user experience, design, and web development.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No devices</strong> are allowed in speaker sessions. We want to provide attendees with a way to disconnect a bit from technology and have conversations in-person without the constant distraction of being always tethered to the internet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Instead of a wifi connection and devices we're going analog. We are providing each attendee with a <strong>custom hard cover notebook</strong> from a local vendor called <a href="http://boundforanything.com/">Bound</a> along a nice pen to write with.
        </li>
        <li>
          As an industry we have a <strong>diverse culture</strong> but if you look at many conference speaker rosters their speaker lists tend to have primarily one group of people. We wanted to focus on creating a truly diverse group of speakers. While our gender diversity is probably the most apparent, our speakers come from various backgrounds, systems of belief, and the list could go on.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Overall, we care about our community. We want people from all walks of life to unite as a community, be inspired, and support each other as fellow human beings.

        Incredibly <b>supportive sponsors</b> that we love
      </h2>
      <p>
        We think sponsorship should be more than just a link and logo on a website. If you're looking to put your sponsorship dollars to use we have a few pretty nifty ideas to get you noticed and be a fun experience for our attendees.
