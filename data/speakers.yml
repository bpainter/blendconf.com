  talkTitle: "C-Speak: Presenting UX To Deciders"
  talkDescription: "<p>UX has hit puberty. Clients and stakeholders are aware of terms like ecosystems, user journeys, and touch-points, but their understanding of exactly what these things are and how to use them for shaping a meaningful strategy is still fuzzy. Business owners now believe that customer experience is one of the best sources for long-term competitive advantages, but they still struggle to foster and achieve great experiences.</p> <p>The good news is that clients increasing look to UX designers for answers about how our work can bring their business strategy to life. We are in a unique position to help companies evolve their strategy so that every touch-point becomes an opportunity for a great user experience. The catch is that to be successful, we must be fluent in the C-speak, the language of C-level executives and business directors, so we can help them recognize pain points and take the right steps to improving the user experience for their product, service, or brand.</p> <p>There is a more strategic role for designers, but traditional design skills will only get you so far. To get a seat at the table with C-level stakeholders and deciders, you must acquire new communication skills and new know-how. This workshop will cover:</p> <ul><li>C-speak 101 – the language of business strategy</li> <li>What UX can add to the conversation that others can’t</li> <li>5 capabilities to add to your repertoire</li> <li>Techniques for communicating decision makers</li></ul> <p>Designers are not generally taught how to define opportunities in ways that are credible in a business context. By learning to speak the language of C-level executives and senior business managers, we can communicate how all channels and touch-points must work together not just stylistically but with strategic intelligence to create a true and lasting value exchange between businesses and customers.</p>"

Even if we do need fallbacks for older browsers, modern tools make it easy. This makes now the perfect time to learn about SVG and how it can help you in everyday web design. Perhaps the most compelling reason: SVG images look sharp at any dimension with tiny file sizes—which is great for making responsive websites responsibly. </p> <p>You’ll also learn how SVG helps make otherwise awkward shapes easy to make, and how to use it to make icons that are more accessible than with any other web-based icon creation technique. You’ll learn how SVG can make customized complex graphics on the fly, create compelling animations and other interactions, and empower some pretty great designerly effects. We’ll end by discovering a cornucopia of SVG source materials that are easy to find and even easier to work with.</p>"

  talkTitle: "More Than UI: How the Brand Plays a Role in the User Experience"
  talkDescription: "<p>For years, branding and user experience design seem to be a discipline mixture more reminiscent of oil and water than peanut butter and jelly. However, the need for companies to communicate their values, messages, personality and products in a multi-channel yet consistent experience makes the line between branding and experience design razor thin. Touching on the intersection of marketing, service design, product design, technology, and customer/user experience, this talk will consider what the UX designer’s role could be within this landscape and whether or not we are (or should be) considering the brand experience in user experience design.</p>"

  talkTitle: "Modern Layouts: Getting Out of Our Ruts"
  talkDescription: "<p>In the early years of the web, there was a lot of variation and experimentation with where to put content on a web page. Then, it seems we all settled into a handful of patterns and stayed there for over a decade. It wasn’t until the arrival of responsive design that new ideas for page layout started appearing. Now with new CSS properties for layout landing in browsers, we may be about to see a bigger renaissance in layout design patterns. How can we better use the space inside the glass rectangle? What layout innovations could help users better find and focus on what they want? Take a walk through where we’ve been, where we might be going, and how we can better design for the true medium at hand. This talk features practical examples of what's newly possible, along with access to a code repo for you to play with later. </p>"

  talkTitle: "Ain't No Party Like A Third-Party JS Party"
  talkDescription: "<p>You've got the hang of this whole JavaScript thing. Your code works on ancient browsers, and positively sings on new ones. AMD, SPA, MVC -- you can do that stuff in your sleep, amirite? </p> <p>But now your users are trying to type in your Very Important Form, and nothing is showing up; you loaded Backbone into your app <i>right there on line 1</i>, but <code>window.Backbone</code> is nowhere to be found; that widget that's supposed to end up in a certain div is showing up somewhere completely different; calls to jQuery's <code>.css()</code> are doing absolutely nothing; and, rarely but not never, your app just doesn't load at all.</p> <p>You <i>thought</i> you had the hang of this whole JavaScript thing, but now you're in the world of third-party JavaScript, where all you control is a single script tag and where it's all but impossible to dream up every hostile environment in which your code will be expected to work. \"It works on my machine\" has never rung quite so hollow.</p> <p>In this talk, we'll take a look at some of the delightful bugs we've had to solve at Bazaarvoice while working on the third-party JavaScript app that collects and displays ratings and reviews for some of the world's largest retailers.</p>"

  talkTitle: "Designing for Love"
  talkDescription: "<p>Spike Jonze's movie Her is about a man falling in love with his OS. The film is science fiction, and the forecasts are both exciting and challenging. As we imagine what’s next, the goal for UX designers is not how to make devices more human or more lovable. The questions we should chase are: How can we create products to sustain and amplify our human relationships rather than to replace or deflect them? Are we looking for technology to meet our needs or help us become less needful? How can we design Things that coax more good from our brains and our hearts?</p>"

  talkTitle: "Web Designer/ Motion Designer"
  talkDescription: "<p>With the current state of CSS and JavaScript the web has seriously stepped up its animation game. As web designers and developers we’ve never had to understand animation principles like we do now. Smart animation comes from thinking like a motion designer when adding animations and transitions to our web work. There is a huge depth of knowledge we can pull from while we design and build the new UIs of the web.</p> <p>In this session we will demonstrate key animation principles like timing, offsets, and others as they apply to UI work on the web. And we'll cover principles specific to UI animation that will make your work both usable and delightful. Consider this your crash course into becoming a web animation pro! </p>"
