He believes that no matter how utilitarian a tool is, at the core of its creation lies a story; uncovering that story is key to its success.</p><p>Adam is also a strong proponent of critique, not only in design, but also as a key component of collaboration, learning, and improvement. Occasionally, he shares his perspectives on design at adamconnor.com and discussingdesign.com.</p>"

    title: "Discussing Design: The Art of Critique"
    desc: "Our ability to critique speaks directly to the quality of the conversations we have around the ideas and designs we create."
    fullDesc: "<p>This workshop will examine the language, rules and strategies for improving the conversations we have around designs through critique.</p><p>Collaboration requires us to share our work; to communicate our ideas with one another and collect other's thoughts in order to know whether the designs and creations we're producing are meeting the objectives of the project. But often we wrestle with collecting feedback. We get comments that are less then helpful because they seem irrelevant or unclear. Or we find that we're getting feedback and reactions at inopportune times rather than points in the process where they would have been useful in informing design decisions.</p><p>Our ability to critique speaks directly to the quality of the conversations we have with teammates, whether they be designers, developers, stakeholders or whomever. Designers frequently complain about the quality and uselessness of the feedback they are given, but we rarely take a step back and examine how to collect useful feedback and make our discussions around our designs more productive.</p><p>By taking the time to examine critique and how it fits into the design process and both an activity and an aspect of any communication we can focus our conversations and improve our ability to collaborate.</p><p>Participants in this workshop will explore various aspects of critique and the qualities that lead to strong and weak feedback through presentation materials and a series of hands-on activities. Each person will be provided with takeaways that can immediately be put to work to create a useful, collaborative environment for discussing designs.</p>"

    fullDesc: "Service Design is often, well deserved, praised for its analytical and strategic advantages. But if we forget to acknowledge the most central aspect of the discipline it will loose its true glimmering power. Design as the element of surprise. Service Design is not Design just because we call it Design. We have to nourish it. Because the purpose of Service Design is to result in the delivery of a valuable experience, design must be a process of creating and executing."

This talk is about how we can think about experiences as environments, made of different modes of information. We'll see some examples of how these modes affect the user experience, and learn a framework for thinking about design problems, regardless of channel, device, or flavor. "

    desc: "We've all found ourselves deep in the heart of a CSS project struggling with mangled CSS selectors, an array of disparately named files, and a deep and nagging feeling that perhaps our markup is not symantic as it should be. But a new hero is arising in CSS-land: Modular CSS. You may know him by one of his many names. SMACSS, Object-Oriented CSS, or BEM. Only he has the power to untangle our worst CSS nightmares. Only he can help us lay a foundation for large CSS projects. In this talk, John Long will delve deep into his bag of tricks to share practical advice about structuring your CSS. We'll talk about a number of helpful principles for simplifying your CSS and look at how modular CSS applies within the context of Sass. You will walk away challenged with something to apply to your current CSS project."

It is easy and often important for us to quickly rush through our wireframes and prototypes to meet a client deadline, but as professionals we must not overlook the subtleties that can turn a good experience into a great experience.  This talk is about the little details we see in apps and websites we use every day, but often fail to notice.  We fail to notice them because they provide for a much smoother user experience. You will learn how to design for these experiences even with a tight deadline and within a agile workflow. After this presentation you'll never look at another app or website the same again.</p>"
