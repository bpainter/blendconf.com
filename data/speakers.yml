  talkDescription: "Rapid development approaches like Agile can be a blessing and a curse for UX practitioners who want to do their best work in the best way. It takes time to fully understand the problems and potential solutions we create for our end-users. However, the time we spend on comprehensive research, design, and development can delay the progress our organizations ultimately make. How do we contribute to the development of good products and solutions without delaying our teams? UX researchers can help be part of that solution. "

We'll also talk about how to choose the right typeface—it's easier than you think, and it's probably not Helvetica. Specifically we'll cover: How to establish a good typographic hierarchy, building a catalog of workhorse typefaces, the dark art of pairing typefaces, best practices for solid readability."

  talkTitle: "Next-level Animations and Effects with SVG"
  talkDescription: "It can be a struggle to translate the details of a design vision into the browser. Creating bitmap images, icons, and graphics can be time consuming and result in inconsistency and difficulty with managing updates. Scalable vector graphics (SVGs) might be just what you're looking for. SVGs are now supported on every modern browser and mobile device, and usage is on the upswing, but most people only use them for icons. Most developers and designers don't realize how powerful and useful SVGs are. From scalable images to full-blown web applications, SVGs fit many needs.  In this session: I will discuss the importance of understanding the capabilities of SVGs and how developers and designers can improve the quality of designs created in the browser.  Through an understanding of SVG capabilities you will know how each layer of Illustrator is rendered through SVGs in the browser.  You won't learn about SVG font icons; you WILL learn about how to efficiently export SVGs so your team won't curse your name. With SVGs you can render each design layer directly in the browser.  Apply filters, lighting effects, gaussian blur, and animations, all directly through the use of this file format. Get exactly what you want in the browser. Plus a few of my favorite tips/tricks about SVG elements and attributes. "

  talkDescription: "I'm shooting in the dark a little here but I'm guessing that you're really, really good at what you do. Even if you're not, I know you're fast-tracking there as quickly as you can. The problem is, what should you spend your time learning? A javascript framework because your coworker said you should? More jQuery, since your boss is just pushing you to get things done as quickly as possible? Or how to build a table, since that's what you actually wanted to try out this weekend? If you're feeling the stress of wanting to learn it all and not feel guilty on the weekends about your furniture building, you're like me: You're a generalist. And that's okay. It's gonna be fine. We'll go over why being a generalist is actually immensely beneficial, why you shouldn't beat yourself up for it, and how you can get to holistic, beautiful products from lots of places, not just from the latest javascript framework (although learning that's lots of fun too)."

It can be hard to know what kind of research to do when and easy to assume that as designers or developers you'll be able make the best call for your user. However, leaving user research out of your  process leaves room for you to spend time working on a feature that isn't a priority for your target customers or implementing a feature ineffectively.  Come to this session to get an overview of the key goals of user research, the key methodologies that any team member can employ, concrete tips for how to select the best method given your goal, and advice to craft your research plans the best way to get the information you're looking for.

  talkDescription: "Whether or not your team expects its designers to write production code, there are some huge benefits of having more overlap between your team's design and development processes. Thinking about design in a modular, object-oriented way can also dramatically improve the experience felt by your end-user. I'd like to tell you two different tales of working with CSS: One is about a UX team @ Amazon whose designers had never professionally pushed code, but were experiencing pain from the disconnect between the design and development processes. And the other is about a young startup whose developers had done most of the designing and writing of CSS until they hired their first design engineer: Me. We'll explore CSS considerations from both the design and engineering sides of the product spectrum and I'll talk a little about how creating a re-usable pattern library with SASS, OOCSS and BEM conventions can empower any team to smooth out an otherwise bumpy product development cycle. Other super fun CSS things we'll discuss working with: \"media objects\", partials, plug and play animations, & my fave responsive grid system."

  talkDescription: "If you're a designer who wants to code, you can learn a lot from online tutorials, side-projects, and contributing to opensource. However, unless you get to work on something with a significant user base, you're unlikely to get exposed to the experiences that will help you write product-level code. For most designers the best way to learn serious front-end development is on the job. Many companies want to attract designer-coders, but they need to back this up with a culture that embraces them, and supports designers with training, tooling, and documentation. In this talk you'll learn how you and your team can build a designer-friendly coding environment to improve design workflows, team collaboration, and product design decisions."
