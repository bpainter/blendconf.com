  talkDescription: "<p>UX has hit puberty. Clients and stakeholders are aware of terms like ecosystems, user journeys, and touch-points, but their understanding of exactly what these things are and how to use them for shaping a meaningful strategy is still fuzzy. Business owners now believe that customer experience is one of the best sources for long-term competitive advantages, but they still struggle to foster and achieve great experiences.</p> <p>The good news is that clients increasing look to UX designers for answers about how our work can bring their business strategy to life. We are in a unique position to help companies evolve their strategy so that every touch-point becomes an opportunity for a great user experience. The catch is that to be successful, we must be fluent in the C-speak, the language of C-level executives and business directors, so we can help them recognize pain points and take the right steps to improving the user experience for their product, service, or brand.</p> <p>There is a more strategic role for designers, but traditional design skills will only get you so far. To get a seat at the table with C-level stakeholders and deciders, you must acquire new communication skills and new know-how. This workshop will cover:</p> <ul><li>C-speak 101 – the language of business strategy</li> <li>What UX can add to the conversation that others can’t</li> <li>5 capabilities to add to your repertoire</li> <li>Techniques for communicating decision makers</li></ul> <p>Designers are not generally taught how to define opportunities in ways that are credible in a business context. By learning to speak the language of C-level executives and senior business managers, we can communicate how all channels and touch-points must work together not just stylistically but with strategic intelligence to create a true and lasting value exchange between businesses and customers.</p>"

Billing hourly, outsourcing, using templates, and all of the other less than exciting parts of the job creep in.</p> <p>So how do you create great work, stay fresh, and avoid starvation all at once?

Even if we do need fallbacks for older browsers, modern tools make it easy. This makes now the perfect time to learn about SVG and how it can help you in everyday web design. Perhaps the most compelling reason: SVG images look sharp at any dimension with tiny file sizes—which is great for making responsive websites responsibly. </p> <p>You’ll also learn how SVG helps make otherwise awkward shapes easy to make, and how to use it to make icons that are more accessible than with any other web-based icon creation technique. You’ll learn how SVG can make customized complex graphics on the fly, create compelling animations and other interactions, and empower some pretty great designerly effects. We’ll end by discovering a cornucopia of SVG source materials that are easy to find and even easier to work with.</p>"

Luckily, there are some things you can do to help your “users” gain more understanding and to produce better outcomes for everyone.

  talkTitle: "Lessons Learned from Teaching Thousands of People to Code"
  talkDescription: "<p>In this session, Heather will share lessons learned from three years of teaching people how to code - first through founding the Canadian not-for-profit Ladies Learning Code, and then through running Canada's original programming bootcamp, HackerYou. She'll share stories of lives changed, amazing projects created by relative beginners, as well as the challenges involved in teaching beginners to code, and how to overcome them. You'll leave this session feeling inspired about the next generation of developers, and maybe even motivated to do your part to expose more beginners to the amazing world of creating - not just consuming - technology and the web. It might leave you looking at the junior developers at your company through a new lens.</p>"

Ladies Learning Code now has chapters in over a dozen cities across Canada and a thriving program for youth. In 2012, Heather spent a year working on a project for the Mozilla Foundation: her job was to build a community of people and organizations in Toronto who care about raising youth as creators – not just consumers – of technology and the web. The project was granted $365,000 in funding from the Ontario Trillium Foundation. Heather was an early investor in ShopLocket, and was recently named one of Canada’s 100 Most Powerful Women in the Trendsetters & Trailblazers category."

The Web has done great things to bring us together across languages and cultures, but that doesn't mean we all understand things the same way, even if we are speaking the same language. This new digital landscape still has much to be explored.</p> <p>In this talk we'll look at the idea of digital fluency and how different levels of understanding can impact experience in ways we might not have considered before. We'll look at some of the psychology behind how fluency influences judgement and perception of digital experiences, and how we can approach experience design to build meaningful connections with the people who use our creations.</p>"

  talkTitle: "More Than UI: How the Brand Plays a Role in the User Experience"
  talkDescription: "<p>For years, branding and user experience design seem to be a discipline mixture more reminiscent of oil and water than peanut butter and jelly. However, the need for companies to communicate their values, messages, personality and products in a multi-channel yet consistent experience makes the line between branding and experience design razor thin. Touching on the intersection of marketing, service design, product design, technology, and customer/user experience, this talk will consider what the UX designer’s role could be within this landscape and whether or not we are (or should be) considering the brand experience in user experience design.</p>"

  talkTitle: "Modern Layouts: Getting Out of Our Ruts"
  talkDescription: "<p>In the early years of the web, there was a lot of variation and experimentation with where to put content on a web page. Then, it seems we all settled into a handful of patterns and stayed there for over a decade. It wasn’t until the arrival of responsive design that new ideas for page layout started appearing. Now with new CSS properties for layout landing in browsers, we may be about to see a bigger renaissance in layout design patterns. How can we better use the space inside the glass rectangle? What layout innovations could help users better find and focus on what they want? Take a walk through where we’ve been, where we might be going, and how we can better design for the true medium at hand. This talk features practical examples of what's newly possible, along with access to a code repo for you to play with later. </p>"

Our multiple devices and subscriptions guide us through our daily lives, which has changed the way we see our world. </p> <p>But how does this love for technology propel us forward to solve the most difficult problems we face as a society: ever growing issues, such as hunger, poverty, climate change, social inequality and injustice?</p> <p>This talk reflects upon where we are as technologists, where we have been and how we can start focusing again on solving hard problems.

  talkDescription: "<p>Designers have a responsibility, not only to themselves and to their clients, but also to the wider world. We are designers because we love to create, but creation without responsibility breeds destruction. Every day, designers all over the world work on projects without giving any thought or consideration to the impact that work has on the world around them. This needs to change. In this bluntly honest talk, Mike will invite you to consider your responsibilities as a designer and embrace your role as gatekeeper. You’ll learn how to increase your influence and be moved to use your powers for good.</p>"
