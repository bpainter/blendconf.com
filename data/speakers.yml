    title: "Discussing Design: The Art of Critique"
    desc: "<p>This workshop will examine the language, rules and strategies for improving the conversations we have around designs through critique.</p><p>Collaboration requires us to share our work; to communicate our ideas with one another and collect other's thoughts in order to know whether the designs and creations we're producing are meeting the objectives of the project. But often we wrestle with collecting feedback. We get comments that are less then helpful because they seem irrelevant or unclear. Or we find that we're getting feedback and reactions at inopportune times rather than points in the process where they would have been useful in informing design decisions.</p><p>Our ability to critique speaks directly to the quality of the conversations we have with teammates, whether they be designers, developers, stakeholders or whomever. Designers frequently complain about the quality and uselessness of the feedback they are given, but we rarely take a step back and examine how to collect useful feedback and make our discussions around our designs more productive.</p><p>By taking the time to examine critique and how it fits into the design process and both an activity and an aspect of any communication we can focus our conversations and improve our ability to collaborate.</p><p>Participants in this workshop will explore various aspects of critique and the qualities that lead to strong and weak feedback through presentation materials and a series of hands-on activities. Each person will be provided with takeaways that can immediately be put to work to create a useful, collaborative environment for discussing designs.</p>"

    desc: "<p>It's been scientifically proven that more diverse communities and workplaces create better products and the solutions to difficult problems are more complete and diverse themselves. Companies are struggling to find adequate talent. So why do we see so few women, people of color, and LGBTQ people at our events and on the about pages of our websites? Even more curiously, why do 60% of women leave the tech industry within 10 years? Why are fewer women choosing to pursue computer science and related degrees than ever before? Why have stories of active discouragement, dismissal, harassment, or worse become regular news?</p> <p>In this talk we’ll examine the causes behind the lack of diversity in our communities, events, and workplaces. We’ll discuss what we can do as community members, event organizers, and co-workers to not only combat this problem, but to encourage positive change by contributing to an atmosphere of inclusivity.</p> <p>Objectives:</p> <ul> <li>Educate about the lack of diversity and why it is a problem</li> <li>Examine what is contributing to both the pipeline issue as well as attrition</li> <li>Isolate what is and isn't working</li> <li>Inspire direct action by examining our own behavior and learning more about the people around us so we can empathize better</li> </ul>"

  bio: "<p>Leslie has been designing since the ‘90’s. Her diverse professional background ranges from working as the graphic designer on a major motion picture to serving as a university professor.</p> <p>While a professor, Leslie earned her Doctorate in Learning and Leadership. Through project-based initiatives that applied design as a catalyst for sustainable change, her work—both in and out of the classroom—focused on creating meaningful relationships between education, industry, and community. Her experience, as a professional designer, professor, and doctoral candidate, gave Leslie a unique perspective to understand that most design students were not graduating with the skills they needed to thrive within industry. She recognized that this skill gap led to hiring companies being unable to hire the talent they needed.</p> <p>Leslie realized that companies needed to hire a specific kind of designer but they could not find the right talent. This lead Leslie to work on design education initiatives such as the development of a holistic curriculum for designers through the The Web Standards Project Education Task Force, the Open Web Education Alliance, and the WE (Web Education) Rock Summit/Tour.</p> <p>After years of service to the University, Leslie understood the constraints of a traditional higher education setting and realized that the constraints were not affording educators the opportunity to adequately prepare their students for a career beyond graduation. This realization inspired her to search for a better way to structure a learning environment to support the needs of students and hiring companies.</p>"

I visit you and listen to all concerns from all stakeholders. Second, I validate. I write a memo articulating what I saw and heard and what I think your key problems are. This memo is usually five or fewer pages. In my experience, there are really only a few things causing big, pervasive problems. Third, I think. I follow up with stakeholders and brainstorm options for resolving your concerns, giving great consideration to your culture. Fourth, I collaborate. Together, we create a governance framework that will be viable and effective for your organization.</p>"

It is easy and often important for us to quickly rush through our wireframes and prototypes to meet a client deadline, but as professionals we must not overlook the subtleties that can turn a good experience into a great experience.  This talk is about the little details we see in apps and websites we use every day, but often fail to notice.  We fail to notice them because they provide for a much smoother user experience. You will learn how to design for these experiences even with a tight deadline and within a agile workflow. After this presentation you'll never look at another app or website the same again.</p>"

    title: "Ruby Meets Clojure Flavored Database"
    desc: "<p>Datomic is a new database categorized as NewSQL and was created by Rich Hickey. Everybody knows this big name and thinks of Clojure. It is true Datomic fits well to Clojure programming. However, it is not only for Clojure people. </p> <p>Absolutely, Rubyists can use it. We have Diametric gem (https://github.com/relevance/diametric). Using Diametric, we can dive into Datomic from Ruby, from Rails.</p> <p>On Diametric, Datomic's entity is an ActiveModel compliant. Diametric supports Rails' scaffolding.Its usage might look like Datamapper or MongoDB. Eventually, Diametric’s API design settled in a bit far from Ruby, Rails style. In another word, it is not ORM-like. Even though the API design may puzzle Rubyists, Diametric chose the one to expose Datomic's intrinsic properties. It is to leverage a good side of Datomic for us. I believe the more Rubyists use Diametric, the more they like it.</p> <p>In my talk, I’ll introduce Diametric gem and how to use it as well as why its API design is good for us. Also, I will cover how Ruby helped to integrate Datomic API in Diametric gem.</p>"

    title: "Putting Flexbox into practice"
    desc: "<p>The Flexible Box Layout module, called &quote;flexbox&quote; for short, is the most fully developed and well supported of CSS3’s wide array of new techniques for creating page layouts. Web developers are itching to use it, and with good reason—flexbox allows you to create fluid, responsive layouts without having to worry about crazy percentage grid widths, negative margins, float drop, and all those pesky CSS layout quirks we’ve dealt with for over a decade.</p> <p>It all sounds great, but how do you actually put it to use in the real world—today? In this session, you’ll learn when to use flexbox, what the browser-specific variants are, and how to use it to build responsive multi-column page layouts without the headache. Plus, for those of us who just want to dip a toe in for now, we’ll look at some practical ideas for how to use flexbox as progressive enhancement, adding it in bits and pieces on individual page components with graceful fallbacks.</p>"
