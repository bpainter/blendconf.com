  title: "Discussing Design: The Art of Critique"
  description: Our ability to critique speaks directly to the quality of the conversations we have around the ideas and designs we create. Whether we're talking to designers, developers, stakeholders or or other team members, we need to work collaboratively. Doing so means that each team member needs to have an understanding of the goals we’ve set for our design and how our design holds up to them. Designers frequently complain about the quality of the feedback they are given, but we rarely take a step back and examine how to collect useful feedback and make our discussions around our designs more productive. This workshop will examine the language, rules and strategies for critique and provide participants with takeaways that can immediately be put to work to create a useful, collaborative environment for discussing designs.
